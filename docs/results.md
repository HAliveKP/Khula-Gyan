# Project work log and results

Updated 2026-10-09. This file keeps previous entries and reports only checks that were actually run. The commit log below includes every Hkp commit through the immediately preceding Day 2 implementation commit. A Git commit cannot contain its own final hash; this log's commit will be included when the log is next updated.

## Commit log

Historical commit metadata, diffs, and combined statuses were rechecked on Hkp. Empty GitHub status lists mean **no status was recorded**, not that a test passed. The only recorded automated status among the historical commits below was CodeRabbit success on `12101ce`.

## Day checklist and evidence

| Day | Owner | Status | Evidence / remaining work |
|---|---|---|---|
| Day 0 | Member 1 — Data & Documents | Partial | Source register exists. No originals are in `data/raw/`; usage terms and a first local extraction remain to be confirmed. |
| Day 0 | Member 2 — Retrieval | Partial | Dependency list and embedding smoke script exist. A successful local model smoke run is not recorded. |
| Day 0 | Member 3 — Generation & Evaluation | Partial | Response contract and starter question drafts exist. Provider choice and a successful LLM call remain pending. |
| Day 0 | Leader — Integration, UI & Repository | Partial | Setup files and README exist; Hkp is the selected branch. Shared `dev` and `main` branches were not created. |
| Day 1 | Member 1 — Data & Documents | Partial | Ten sources are registered and a preliminary extraction report exists. No files were downloaded or locally extracted. |
| Day 1 | Member 2 — Retrieval | Partial | Chunking and Chroma index code exist. A sample dataset and populated index have not been produced. |
| Day 1 | Member 3 — Generation & Evaluation | Pending | `src/generation/answer.py` and the 15-question Day 1 set are not present. |
| Day 1 | Leader — Integration, UI & Repository | Done for mock | `ask()` and the initial Streamlit screen were added; the screen was not launched in this environment. |
| Day 2 | Member 1 — Data & Documents | In progress | PDF/HTML extraction, NFC cleanup, repeated header/footer removal, and page-linked JSONL output are implemented. Synthetic HTML checks passed. Process a permitted official source and inspect each page when the download and PyMuPDF prerequisites are available. |
| Day 2 | Member 2 — Retrieval | Pending (not part of this request) | The real `src/retrieval/search.py` module is not present, so index search cannot yet run end to end. |
| Day 2 | Member 3 — Generation & Evaluation | Pending (not part of this request) | The real `src/generation/answer.py` module is not present, so no answer generation or evaluation can run. |
| Day 2 | Leader — Integration, UI & Repository | In progress | `ask()` now connects to the documented `search()` and `answer()` interfaces when available; the UI has citation display, loading, and friendly error states. It safely returns `not_found` until those modules and reviewed source text exist. Optional FastAPI was skipped. |

## Evaluation results

Only real output from `eval/run_eval.py` against human-verified civic questions and source chunks belongs in this table. The runner is present, but there is no verified civic evaluation set or permitted civic-source index available for a baseline. The offline synthetic fixture harness is a plumbing check; its mock percentages are not project quality metrics. Unmeasured values remain `-`.

| Run / build | Date | Questions | hit@5 | Citation accuracy | Answer correctness | Refusal rate | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Day 0–2 baseline | - | - | - | - | - | - | No human-verified civic question set and permitted civic-source index are available for a real baseline. |

## Setup verification (2026-10-10)

| Check | Result | Evidence / limits |
|---|---|---|
| Offline pytest suite | Pass | `4 passed`; includes synthetic processor metadata, Chroma score/filter behavior, draft-question skipping, and Git tracking guard. Ran with a repo-local pytest temp directory because the sandbox temp directory is not writable. |
| Synthetic evaluation harness | Pass | The offline fixture runner wrote one ignored run record and skipped the draft item. Its mock percentages are not civic evaluation results and were not copied into the evaluation table. |
| Pinned dependency consistency | Pass | `pip check`: `No broken requirements found.` |
| Embedding smoke check | Pass | Script printed `Embedding smoke check passed: 10 examples (5 Nepali + 5 English), vector size 1024`. Hugging Face warned that free cache space was slightly below the model's advertised download size. |
| GNU Make setup target | Not run | `make setup` failed because `make` is not installed in this Windows environment. The existing `.venv` was already available. |
| Source downloads / index build | Not run | Setup-only session; no source pages or index were downloaded or built. |
